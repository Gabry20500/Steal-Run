# Steal-Run

This repository contains the source code and assets for the game "Steal & Run," a 2D platform stealth game where players take on the role of a thief infiltrating a museum to steal valuable items.

## Gameplay Overview
Steal & Run is divided into two main phases:
- **Stealth Phase:** Infiltrate the museum, avoid guards' line of sight, and collect secondary items to increase your score. Triggering alarms or getting caught leads to a restart.
- **Runner Phase:** Once the valuable object is obtained, alarms sound, and the player must escape. Guards pursue the player, requiring strategic dodging while racing to exit the museum before the police arrive.

## Features
- Stealthy movement mechanics: sneaking, running, crouching, jumping, and interacting with the environment.
- Guard AI with vision cones and patrols.
- Diverse obstacles like lasers, traps, and security cameras.
- Score system influenced by time taken and items collected.
- Intuitive controls for evasion during the runner phase.
